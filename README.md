# Sparse-Matrix-Multiplication

### Built a distributed sparse matrix multiplication system using MPI for sharing data and computing multiplication order efficiently
### Developed a hybrid engine combining CUDA and OpenMP based on heuristics for high- and low-cost multiplications
### Designed efficient logic with MPI_Gatherv and MPI_Send/Recv to gather and distribute matrix metadata and computation results
### Improved performance by integrating GPU acceleration with CPU parallelism, enabling scalable sparse matrix multiplication across nodes


Used 1 GPU, <8 CPUs with 16 cores each to do the assignment
